### Overview

This very blog was born out of the necessity to showcase my projects and recount a little about me and my coding journey.

Now, this blog could have very well been hosted at GitHub or Netlify, but being familiar with Django, I settled for Heroku. 

### Features and Complexity

- This blog is a responsive web-app.
- Makes use of models to store entries instead of hardcoding them into .html files.
- The backend is powered by a relational database.
- It is written in Python and JavaScript.
- Allows entries to be written in Markdown.
- Renders Markdown content into .html.
- Automatically detects and responds to system's dark and light themes.
